This project collects various science portals based on the GAVOdachs distribution
(see http://vo.ari.uni-heidelberg.de/soft/). Starting point is the re-producible
deployment of the GAVO datacentre software on a machine, either in the EC2 cloud
or on a stand-alone server. This deployment is driven by the excellent Python
fabric (http://fabfile.org) and boto (https://github.com/boto/boto) modules.
