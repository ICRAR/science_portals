NGAS Portal Installation Guide
==============================

NOTE: Still not completely automatic, but getting close.

fab -f src/deploy.py test_deploy

this will launch an EC2 instance create the user ngas and install Zope2 and the NGAS site content.

After that it is still required to login to the instance and import the NGAS.zexp into the running server.


Launching the server as user ngas:

> ngas_portal/ngas/bin/zopectl start




NOTE: It might be that the server is listening on IP address 127.0.0.1, depending on the IP configuration.
This can be checked in the following way:

> cat ngas_portal/ngas/log/event.log
------
2013-08-14T01:33:17 INFO ZServer HTTP server started at Wed Aug 14 01:33:17 2013
	Hostname: 0.0.0.0
	Port: 8080
------
2013-08-14T01:33:18 INFO Zope Ready to handle requests


use the IP address reported at the Hostename above and do a ping:

> ping 0.0.0.0
PING 0.0.0.0 (127.0.0.1) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from 127.0.0.1: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.029 ms
64 bytes from 127.0.0.1: icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time=0.021 ms
64 bytes from 127.0.0.1: icmp_seq=3 ttl=64 time=0.021 ms
^C

This now reports 127.0.0.1 and it means that the server indeed is listening on the
localhost IP address only. This means that it is not accessible from anywhere else
than the machine itself.

This can be changed in the zope.conf file. Open the file with your favourite text editor (e.g. vi):

> vi /home/ngas/ngas_portal/ngas/etc/zope.conf

and search for the string 'ip-address'. Uncomment the line found there and change the IP address
to the public IP address of the host the portal has been installed on. Then stop and start the zope server again.

> ngas_portal/ngas/bin/zopectl stop
> ngas_portal/ngas/bin/zopectl start
